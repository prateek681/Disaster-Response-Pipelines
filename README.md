# Disaster-Response-Pipelines

## Project Description

This a multi-label classification project, where a model is built to classify messages which are sent during disasters. There are a given set of categories such as Medical Help, Search and Rescue, Food, from which the message input by the user will be categorized. The main aim of the project is to replicate an emergency system, where the Disasters in form of messages from users are categorized. 

### Data Source
The Data was provided by [Appen](https://www.figure-eight.com/), which contains real-world disaster data. 

## Folder Descriptions
* App: This folder includes the run.py and the templates used for the web application
* Data: This folder includes the .csv, .db and the .py file
* process_data.py: This script utillizes the input csv files which contains the message dataand the message categoires (labels) and creates an SQLite Database which contains a merged and cleaned version of the data
* Models: This folder contains the pickle object and train_classifier.py file
* train_classifier.py: Script to tune a ML Model from a SQLite Database which was generated from process_data.py. Output of the file is the fitted model.
* Notebooks: This folder contains the Notebooks ETL Pipeline Preparation and ML Pipeline Preparation, which were used as a reference to generate the .py files for the Development of the Application [Note: This Folder and its files are not needed for the application to run]

## Project Instructions
1. Run the following commands in the project's root directory to set up your database and model.

    - To run ETL pipeline that cleans data and stores in database
        `python data/process_data.py data/disaster_messages.csv data/disaster_categories.csv data/DisasterResponse.db`
    - To run ML pipeline that trains classifier and saves
        `python models/train_classifier.py data/DisasterResponse.db models/classifier.pkl`

2. Run the following command in the app's directory to run your web app.
    `python run.py`

3. Go to http://0.0.0.0:3001/
